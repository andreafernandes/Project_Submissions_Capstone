# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud651/l-770038733/e-867869590/m-901058638

# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to continue the investigation you did at the
# end of Problem Set 4 or you can start fresh and choose a different
# data set from Gapminder.

# If youâ€™re feeling adventurous or want to try some data munging see if you can
# find a data set or scrape one from the web.

# In your investigation, examine 3 or more variables and create 2-5 plots that make
# use of the techniques from Lesson 5.

# You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
#       1. the variable(s) you investigated, your observations, and any summary statistics
#       2. snippets of code that created the plots
#       3. links to the images of your plots

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.

###My "Gapminder" project Aims and Objectives using the Antidepressant Dataset

####**Part 1: Antidepressant Use in Secondary Mental Health Care Patients** 

The aim of this part of the project is to understand how antidepressants are used among depressed patients in this secondary mental health care setting. In other words, what are the common prescriptions of antidepressants in this secondary mental health care facility? How are antidepressants prescribed? Is the entire cohort receiving antidepressant treatment?

####**Part 2: Comparing Antidepressant users to Non antidepressant users**

All patients in this cohort have a diagnosis of depression. About half the individuals in this cohort are not on any antidepressants during the snapshot. Are there any differences in the patients using antidepressants compared to patients not using antidepressants?

####**Part 3: Antidepressant Use and Suicide Attempt**

There is some indication that one of the side-effects of antidepressant use is suicidality (i.e. suicidal ideation, suicdie attempt or death by suicide) [ref]. Conducting preliminary analysis, is there any indication that use of antidepressant may be associated with suicide attempts?

###THE DATASET

**Description of the Antidepressant dataset.**

The dataset used here is a 6 month snapshot of antidepressant use among mental health patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression. 

**Data Source**

The data is derived from a mental health clinical trust based in South London and covers an area with a population of around 1.4 million residents. The trust provides secondary mental health care to individuals who are referred by GPs, privately referred, A&E and self-referrals.

In 2008, a research facility was founded which used pseudonymised the electronic clinical records from the South London trust for research and clinical audit purposes. Currently there are ~250000 records within this research database. Within the database, there are around 70000 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of dperession, who were known to the trust (comorbid depression included). 

**The Sample**

To investigate or explore AntiDepressant (AD) use I selected individuals who met both of the following criteria:

|_Inclusion Criteria_|
|:-------|
| 1) Patient had a clinical diagnosis of dpression but no other major mental disorder (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder etc)|
| 2) Patient had some face to face contact with clinical staff at some point during the 1st of March 2014 to 31st August 2014. |

******

The sample consisted of 4157 patients.

|_**Acronym Key**_|  |

|Snapshot period | Randomly selected 6 month period from 1st of March, 2014 to the 31st of August, 2014|

___What's the most common antidepressant prescribed?___

      - Mirtazapine, an atypical antidepressant with noradrenergic and specific serotonergic activity, is the 
      
        MOST COMMONLY prescribed / used antidepressant within the 6-month snapshot period. 
      
      - Followed by SSRI Sertraline, SSRI Citalopram, SNRI Venlafaxine and SSRI Fluoxetine.

####Type of Antidepressant Users

Are patients being prescribed single antidepressant drugs or in combination?

******














![](Antidepressants_files/figure-html/Chunk J5.1-1.png)

******

Antidepressants are most commonly prescribed as single antidepressants.

******

![](Antidepressants_files/figure-html/Chunk J6-1.png)

******

Patients who are prescribed multiple antidepressants get prescribed different classes of antidepressants as opposed to antidepressants within the same class (e.g. SSRI in combination with an SNRI as opposed to another SSRI).

*******

Here's corresponding numbers to the graphs above.

###Part 3: Antidepressant Use and Suicide Attempt

There is some evidence that antidepressant use may lead to suicidal ideation and attempts. Here i will explore the suicide attempt variable and ascertain whether it is associated / correlated with antidepressant use. 

If there is a significant association, can we pinpoint to a specific class of antidepressants?

_What do the above tables and test tell you about patients attempting suicide and antidepresant use?_

      - About **two thirds** of my cohort have attempted suicide within the snapshot period. 
      
      - There is a difference in the proportion of individuals who attempt suicide in 
      
      antidepressant user versus antidepressant non user groups. 
      
      - This difference is significant with a p-value < 0.005
